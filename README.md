For a tutorial how to use it read the Itch io page.

Standalone modding software for the video game ZERO Sievert by CABO Studio. It replaces the Display names of the weapons in the game in a non destructive way.

Version 2 improves the user experience greatly and doesn't require the heavy upfront time investment of v1.
